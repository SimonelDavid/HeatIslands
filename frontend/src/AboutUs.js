Simply input your location and select a time period; though we suggest opting for the summer months to get the most relevant data.

        For regional administrators looking to mitigate heat effects, we extend a collaborative hand. Our platform not only identifies heat islands but also offers strategic recommendations tailored to your region's specific land cover and heat conditions.
